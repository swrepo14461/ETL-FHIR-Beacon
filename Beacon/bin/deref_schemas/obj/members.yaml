  description: 'List of members of the pedigree. If the current pedigree definition
    is attached to the proband, it contains the whole list of pedigree members, including
    the proband. If the definition is attached to an individual different than the
    proband, it only contains two entries: one that describes that member, e.g. the
    proband mother or father, and one that points to the proband.'

          the same Beacon datasets or not, in which case the information here is meant
          to complete the pedigree. If the individual is also in the dataset use that
          Individual ID. If it is not the in the dataset, use a non-collading ID,
          e.g. concatenating the Pedigree ID with a local ID, similarly to the example
          'Pedigree1001-m1'.
