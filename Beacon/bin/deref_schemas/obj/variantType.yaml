variantType:
  default: SNP
  description: The `variantType` declares the nature of the variation in relation
    to a reference. In a response, it is used to describe the variation. In a request,
    it is used to declare the type of event the Beacon client is looking for. If in
    queries variants can not be defined through a sequence of one or more bases (`precise`
    variants) it can be used standalone (i.e. without `alternateBases`) together with
    positional parameters. Examples here are e.g. queries for structural variants
    such as `DUP` (increased allelic count of material from the genomic region  between
    `start` and `end` positions without assumption about the placement of the additional
    sequence) or `DEL` (deletion of sequence following `start`). Either `alternateBases`
    or `variantType` is required, with the exception of range queries (single `start`
    and `end` parameters).
  examples:
  - SNP
  - DEL
  - DUP
  - BND
  type: string
