      $comments: From https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema/blob/v2/docs/gestational-age.rst
      $schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
      description: 'Gestational age (or menstrual age) is the time elapsed between
        the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the day of delivery.
        The first day of the last menstrual period occurs approximately 2 weeks before
        ovulation and approximately 3 weeks before implantation of the blastocyst.
        Because most women know when their last period began but not when ovulation
        occurred, this definition traditionally has been used when estimating the
        expected date of delivery. In contrast, chronological age (or postnatal age)
        is the time elapsed after birth. Provenance: Phenopackets v2'
