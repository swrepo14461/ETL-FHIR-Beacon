alternateBases:
  description: |-
    Alternate bases for this variant (starting from `start`). * Accepted values: IUPAC codes for nucleotides (e.g. `https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html`). * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base, and can beused as
      a standalone base of any type or within a partially knownsequence. As example,
      a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of[ACGT] and will match
      `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.
    * an *empty value* is used in the case of deletions with the maximally
      trimmed, deleted sequence being indicated in `ReferenceBases`
    * Categorical variant queries, e.g. such *not* being represented through
      sequence & position, make use of the `variantType` parameter.
    * Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.'
