variantInternalId:
  description: Reference to the **internal** variant ID. This represents the primary
    key/identifier of that variant **inside** a given Beacon instance. Different Beacon
    instances may use identical id values, referring to unrelated variants. Public
    identifiers such as the GA4GH Variant Representation Id (VRSid) MUST be returned
    in the `identifiers` section. A Beacon instance can, of course, use the VRSid
    as their own internal id but still MUST represent this then in the `identifiers`
    section.
  examples:
  - var00001
  - v110112
  type: string
