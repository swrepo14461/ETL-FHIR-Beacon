referenceBases:
  description: |-
    Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`). * Accepted values: IUPAC codes for nucleotides (e.g. `https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html`). * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base, and can be used
      as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known sequence. As
      example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of `[ACGT]` and
      will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.
    * an *empty value* is used in the case of insertions with the maximally
      trimmed, inserted sequence being indicated in `AlternateBases`.
    NOTE: Beacon instances may not support UIPAC codes and it is not mandatory for them to do so. In such cases the use of [ACGTN] is mandated.
  examples:
  - A
  - T
  - N
  - ''
  - ACG
  pattern: ^([ACGTUNRYSWKMBDHV\-\.]*)$
